Forksteroids is my submission for the GitHub Game off 2012 challenge.

Built using HTML5 canvas with a mix of jQuery and Vanilla JS while learning everything as I went along.


**Game objective:**
The game is really simple, avoid the spaceforks and get a high score. The higher your score the more spaceforks fly down to get you.

Tested in Google Chrome, Safari and IE9.
